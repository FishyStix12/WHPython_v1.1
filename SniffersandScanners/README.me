**Important Note: For net_terrorizer.py to work please install the scapy and nmap python libraries in linux using the following commands below:** <br />
   pip install scapy <br />
   sudo apt-get update <br />
   sudo apt-get install nmap <br />
   pip install python-nmap <br />

**The Following List gives a short description of all the scripts in this group:** <br />
1. net_terrorizer.py - This Python script provides a comprehensive tool for conducting customizable Nmap network scans, allowing users to interactively select specific Nmap scripts and scan options. Users can specify a list of remote IP addresses or CIDR notations and define port ranges for their scans. The script prompts users to choose from a wide array of Nmap scripts, each designed to perform different tasks such as detecting web server honeypots, analyzing firewall rules, retrieving service banners, and identifying vulnerabilities. New additions include scripts for detecting SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities, identifying SSH authentication methods, and checking for the presence of backdoors in FTP servers. After executing the scan, the script offers the option to save the detailed results, including any found CVEs and Metasploit modules, to a user-defined text file. This functionality makes the script a powerful and flexible tool for network exploration, security assessment, and detailed documentation. <br />
2. darknet_recon.py - The script provided is a Python tool for conducting network scans using Nmap and searching for Metasploit modules corresponding to identified vulnerabilities. It prompts the user to input remote IP addresses or CIDR notations for scanning. After performing Nmap scans to discover hosts and their open ports along with potential vulnerabilities, the script simulates finding CVE IDs. It then utilizes Metasploit's `msfconsole` command-line tool to search for exploit modules related to the identified CVEs. The user is prompted to enter the superuser password when required for executing commands. Overall, this script serves as a versatile tool for network reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment, seamlessly integrating Nmap and Metasploit functionalities. <br />
3. dark_wizard_gui.py - **Important Note: Please use this script as a superuser for it to work, and know that if you leave the port field blank it will do a full port scan, and will take time to load!** This Python script creates a graphical user interface (GUI) application named "Dark Net Wizard" using Tkinter. The application allows users to perform Nmap scans with firewall evasion techniques on specified target IP addresses or CIDR ranges. It includes options for inputting target ports or port ranges, and it displays the scan results, including any found Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and Metasploit exploit modules if they exist. The GUI features a dark purple background color, an image display at the top (which can be replaced with a custom image link), input fields for IP addresses and ports, buttons for scanning and exiting the application, and an output box for displaying scan results and messages. <br />
